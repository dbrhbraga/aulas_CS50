It is possible to verify through the analysis of the 100 most played songs in our sample some data about their danceability, energy, and balance.

After calculations, it's accurate to say that the DANCEABILITY stood out, pointing out an average of 0.71646,
followed by ENERGY with a relatively high average of 0.65906, and the VALANCE average of 0.484443.

The VALANCE average showed that this user listened to both sad and happy music, which points to the Blue Mood group.


Data, in general, cannot be interpreted so blindly. One can listen to happy music when sad to change their mood.
The same can happen when someone is discouraged and listens to energetic music to cheer themselves up.
