                      <p>I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County,
                        hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim,
                        committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina and strolled down Swann's Way.
                        It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric,
                        but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything</p>

                                  - Rory bought a copy of The Children’s Hour, a 1930s play by Lillian Hellman about two headmistresses of an all-girls school who are accused of being lesbians, for her mom. The play deals with a number of issues, chief among them the stringent conservatism of American social and political establishments. Naturally, this play resonated with Lorelai, given her tension-filled relationship with her parents, marked by generational anxieties. Lorelai’s life had been defined by rebellion and social exclusion— she ran away from her parent’s home and the life she knew after getting pregnant with Rory. The play also has the added appeal of being relatively overlooked, and Rory and Lorelai have never met an obscure cultural reference they didn’t like.

                                    <strong>Howl by Allen Ginsberg - Rory & Jess.</strong> I wouldn’t be surprised if paperback sales of Howl, Allen Ginsberg’s seminal work of poetry, suddenly spiked after this season-two episode aired. Didn’t we all want to impress a guy like Jess, a James Dean wannabe who accessorized with an interminable scowl? I imagine Jess, who favored the aggressive, hypermasculine compositions of Charles Bukowski and Hunter S. Thompson, was in love with the idea of falling in love with a girl who had Howl on her bookshelf. Jess swiped the book off Rory’s bookshelf without asking and returned it to her later, with notes in the margin. For a girl like Rory, this was the grandest of romantic gestures (she didn’t get out much).

                                      <strong>Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, Rory & Grandparents</strong> - Richard and Emily Gilmore were at times the best part of watching Gilmore Girls. Their relationships to each other, their daughter, and their granddaughter were often contentious. Yet, at day's end, they were completely lovable grandparents. When they returned from their second honeymoon, they brought Rory a 100-year-old copy of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass—in Latin. It’s a gift that signifies the aristocratic pretensions that had destroyed their relationship with their daughter, Lorelai, but enriches their relationship with Rory.

                                      <strong>Rory & Dean</strong> - Very few among us—by us, I mean Generation Gilmore—were on Team Dean. Dean made cardinal TV character errors: he was dull and had a disastrous haircut. However, Dean somehow connected with viewers when he bitingly referred to Anna Karenina, Rory’s favorite book, as “depressing.” It is depressing! But of course, Rory loved it because she loved any book that made her look impressive as she traipsed through Stars Hollow. Rory also identified with Anna, the title character stuck in a marriage of convenience to Count Karenin, who engages in an illicit affair with the dashing young Count Vronsky. Rory’s a Count Vronsky kind of girl, and Dean was Count Karenin. No wonder they broke up by the end of the episode.

                                       - Rory’s entire relationship with Logan was an outstanding exercise in magical thinking, the idea that one could will their desires into existence through sheer force of hope. On paper, Logan was an ideal boyfriend. His upper-class pedigree and Ivy League education appealed to the genteel sensibilities of her grandparents. But Rory always had a taste for self-destructive bad boys, and Logan’s mean streak and perpetual drunkenness fit the bill. It would never really work out for them, though not for lack of trying. Rory read this Didion classic on a Valentine’s Day trip to Martha’s Vineyard with Logan, Lorelai, and Luke. The weekend turns disastrous when Logan's father, Mitchum, abruptly demands that Logan leave for a business trip to London.
